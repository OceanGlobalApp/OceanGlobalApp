## Smart Contracts

In the [smart-contracts](https://github.com/OceanGlobalApp/smart-contracts) directory, you'll find a collection of OpenZeppelin-based smart contracts that power various aspects of the Ocean Global platform. These contracts include:

- **Locker**: Securely lock liquidity or tokens using a non-custodial smart contract.
- **Presale**: Conduct decentralized presales on popular EVM blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum.
- **Crowdsale**: Manage and execute decentralized crowdsales, ensuring a fair and transparent fundraising process.
- **Private Sale**: Facilitate private sales with customizable parameters to meet project-specific requirements.
- **Token Minter**: Create custom BEP20 tokens effortlessly using Ocean Global's token minting functionality.

## Why OpenZeppelin

We leverage the power of OpenZeppelin's smart contracts to ensure security, reliability, and industry-standard best practices. OpenZeppelin is a leading library for secure smart contract development, offering battle-tested implementations that reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our platform.
